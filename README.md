Balay Ha Buksu Reservation System 

# System description:
The system aims to have online reservations. It will allow the customer to book a reservation
ahead of time; the customer will know it when they select a date. It will also allow the customer
to know the details of the rooms, the function hall, and the availability of catering services. The
system will allow the administrative staff to know and add the employee that will be allowed to
update the facilities and services on the system. This aims to eliminate the manuality when it 
comes to updating and knowing the booked and reserved schedules.
